Here's the link to my dataset of 25 handgestures (both one-hand and two hands). It is divided into train and valid folders.
The train folder contains 200 images per gesture for training and valid folder contains 50 images per gesture for validation.
The images were taken in 6 different backgrounds and 2 persons to introduce variance. The Siamese model was trained on this 
dataset.
