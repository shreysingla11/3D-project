Here's the link to my dataset of 5 gestures. It contans division into train,test and valid folders. Train folder contains
approximately 330 images per gesture whereas test and valid folders contain approximately 110 images per gesture respectively.
The images were taken in 8 separate backgrounds and 2 different people to introduce variance.
