Here's the link to my dataset of 15 different handgestures (both one-hand and two hands). It is divided into train and valid folders. 
Train folder contains 50 images per gesture whereas valid folder contains 15 images per gestures. It was created only to 
test the working of Siamese network and there is not much variance in the dataset.
